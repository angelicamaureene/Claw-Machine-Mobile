  "Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours - Paris, Taylor Swift - Even though we’re not public with everyone in our lives, I wouldn’t care less because it’s just as real even in secret",
  "I wanna transport you to somewhere the culture’s clever - Paris, Taylor Swift - I wanna be with you everywhere and anywhere, if it happens so that the place is beautiful, magical, and or at all whimsical, it’s just an added bonus, because your beauty is truly all that is needed",
  "And every time I look at you, it’s like the first time, I fell in love with a careless man’s careful daughter, she is the best thing that’s ever been mine - Mine, Taylor Swift - YOU, you truly are the best thing that’s ever been mine, and I promise to not be as careless as your father and to show care in a plethora of different ways to always assure you and never leave room for any doubts",
  "I can’t help but wish you took me with you, and this is when the feeling sinks in, I don’t wanna miss you like this. Come back, be here, come back be here - Come Back…Be Here, Taylor Swift - I know it was inevitable, but I just didn’t know it would ache this hard knowing you’re completely on the opposite side of the world from me. For now I’ll spend every second counting down to when I may see you again",
  "This is falling for you and you are worlds away. In New York, be here. But you’re in London, and I break down, cause it’s not fair that you’re not around- Come Back…Be Here, Taylor Swift - In this city is the last place anyone ever wants to be in, and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy, but more than ever do I wish you come back to this god forsaken city",
  "Lovelorn and nobody knows, love thorns all over this rose - Slut, Taylor Swift - Our relationship is nobody business as much as people think they know of it and what of it, they simply just don’t, they never will. Only you and I will ever truly know our rose looks like",

Oh cause it’s gravity, oh keeping you with me - Dancing with our Hands Tied, Taylor Swift - Truly I am an utter mess, more than one could imagine, and you choosing me is unimaginable my love. For you I’ll spend forever cleaning in hopes that I can be deserving of you",
  "Long night with your hands up in my hair. Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs. Stay here, honey, I don’t wanna share - Delicate, Taylor Swift - Our birthday night (or I guess I shall say our birthday midnight), all the way to hearing our footsteps down your stairs along with Naia’s or even the same at my place with Sparkle’s, moments like those I wish and crave to last forever, but alas those are always the shortest",
  "And I can’t let you go your handprint’s on my soul. It’s like your eyes are liquor, it’s like your body is gold - End Game, Taylor Swift - You’ve made your mark on me literally and figuratively, and I could not be more happier. Your eyes have the ability to lure me in and have me addicted at first glance as if your the first sip to a Bellini, your body of gold, a true treasure that shall be cherished and adored",
  "And the voices that implore, “You should be doing more” to you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it - Sweet Nothings, Taylor Swift - Whenever I feel as though the world asks more of me or from me, or if I’m not doing enough, you’re always there to remind me otherwise, and reassure me all is well. I could never thank you enough  for that my love, I want to be the same and give the same sense of a safety net for you and keep you warm in the world’s coldest",
  "All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing - Sweet Nothings, Taylor Swift - You want nothing more from me than the most simplest of things, and in response I’d rather say you deserve way more than just the bare minimum and you deserve everything in this world. But just telling you that is never enough, I want to prove it, everyday with more than just my words, and if I don’t hold me responsible for being a liar my love",
  "With you, I made a pact. I knew it when your comfort felt like love that lasts. And then you kissed my lips, I knew with that first kiss, I want to spend my life with you for eternity - Sweet Nothings, Denise Julia - This entire song is a whole message I want to share with you, so I nudge you to give it a listen.",
  "Let them be them, let us be us. Love is a maze, damn but you is amaze yeah - Love Maze, BTS - Gosh baby how do I even explain. I don’t care much for what people wanna say or do, all I know is at the end of the day all my care and attention will all just be consumed by you so anything other than you is simply irrelevant. You’re the true amazing thing in the world",
  "Because your laughter and happiness is the scale of my happiness - Her, BTS - It is baby, it truly is, simple and plain",

",
  "You got me falling from the ceiling for ya. Knew right from the start there was no limit to ya. And I’m catching feelings, baby - Feels Kehlani - From the very beginning you really made me fall face plant for you, from the beginning of our dip I was so scared I’d drop you because of how drop dead gorgeous you looked from that view",
  "It’s the beat that my heart skips when I’m with you. But I still don’t understand just how your love can do what no one else can - Crazy in Love, Beyonce - I don’t even know how to explain it, I can just feel my heart pulsing out of my neck each time in such rhythmic beating that can’t even be described with words, and it comes from just the mere thoughts of you, your presence isn’t even needed, although with your presence it grows more alarmingly stronger",
  "There she goes racing though my brain, and I just can’t contain this feelin’ that remains - There she goes, The La’s - All you do is race in my head, so much so this song plays a loop in my head because it associates it with you",

  "Always, I want to write you, kiss you, ache toward you - Vita, 1927 - More than that I want to draw you, feel you, embrace you, and cherish you, I want to know every inch of you, know you more than I know the back of my own hand",
  "Your sweet voice - my heart groans with longing when I hear it - Fragment 88, Sapho - All I can do is quiver at excitement whenever I hear your voice, then when trying to replicate it in my head I can’t help but get goosebumps, but it can never compare to the real thing",

  "You make it impossible not to feel - Bridgerton S1 - The feelings you give me need to studied in a lab or something because I swear they are so indescribable that they probably don’t even exist yet, truly I think you invented new feelings within me, and I personally cannot get enough",

  "You are the one who makes it impossible to look away - Bridgerton S2 - Baby, you command the eyes of everyone in the room with you. I know from personal experience, once my eyes lay on you I can’t help but stare and when out in public I can’t even look at you once because it only takes one glance and I’m glued forever you don’t even understand",
  "You are my heart, and even when my mind is lost, my heart knows you - Queen Charlotte - Sometimes I lose all thoughts and zone out, but the only thing that remains is thoughts of you and the space you occupy within my heart",
  "I cannot breathe when you are not near, my heart calls for your name - Queen Charlotte - For someone who is asthmatic you really do take my breath away, I think I need to invest in my puffer again.

  "It’s not like in the movies. It’s better, because it’s real - To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before - That’s absolutely the best part, I can watch a million different movies, and feel a million different things for each one, and still nothing will ever compare to the feeling I get when I’m with you and think about us and our relationship",
  "You’re the one I want to talk to, you’re my person - To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before - You’re the only one I ever want to actually share meaningful conversation with, everything else is just all talk to pass time, yours is talk to lose track of time in. The kind that once over I’m stuck wishing for more, or for the time to reset and give me more time with you",
  "We need that touch from the one we love, almost as much as we need air - Five Feet Apart - Just with one touch and I completely crumble in submission for you, one touch is all it takes till I’m subdued in your spell",
  "It’s not finding your perfect half, it’s finding the other half of you - The Half of It - You’re both, all of the above and more, you’re truly my better half, the one I was always unconsciously looking and longing for, and now that I’ve found you I don’t know what life was before you",
  "She’s beautiful, but not just the kind of beautiful you see, the kind that’s hard to look away from - The Half of It - You’re the kind that captivates me with one glance, with one pierce of the eye and I’m drowning and I can’t manage to swim back",
  "I don’t want perfect, I want honest, I want messy. I want us - Always be my Maybe - No matter how tedious and meticulous it gets for us, I don’t care whatsoever, as long as it’s still us and we still both want us",
  "I was stupid, and scared , and insecure, but mostly I missed you - Always be my Maybe - I can get in over my head with many things, but I’ll always make sure it doesn’t affect us negatively, but I’ll always just be missing you",
  "Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss, but very once in a while, you find someone who’s iridescent - Flipped - You, you are that iridescent rare find. There is no others like you, you shine so brightly everything else pales in comparison my love",
  "So this is love, so this is what makes life divine - Cinderella - Life with you is more than just divine, it’s absolutely magical and twinkling in all the best ways possible. I didn’t know how just divine life could get until you",
  "You were my new dream - Tangled - I have many dreams but now all those dreams include you, you are the most special part about all those dreams now, and that just makes me want to work even harder towards them",
  "Now that I see you, I see everything differently - Tangled - Now everything matters in a new light, more than ever I see things as for you and I. Nothing in a single perspective but for an us perspective",
  "My dream wouldn’t be complete without you in it - The Princess and the Frog - You’re the piece that completes it all, you complete my dreams entirely",
  "The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all - Mulan - You are that flower, with the life you live and the way you live it, your life truly isn’t the easiest my love and I can’t help but melt in admiration with the way you lead it. Head held up high and heart hard in chest you live life in the way people write about, and that is one of the best parts about you",
  "You’re the fairest of them all, but you’re kindness makes you beautiful - Snow White - It is not just your beauty that I can’t help but fawn over, it’s your kindness and gentleness the radiates off of you, the way you talk about your sister with such softness, the way you talk about your friends in the most admirable way and the way you talk about Naia all with strength and joy",
  "There’s this girl, she’s smart, and- and fun and beautiful. She’s got these eyes that just- and this hair wow- and her smile awh!! - Aladdin - Every single fucking thing he just said"
